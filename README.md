## 🚗 Luxro – Indian Car Rental Web Application

Luxro is a modern, full-featured car rental web application built with Angular, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and Firebase SDK. This is a complete frontend system — not just a landing page — designed to simulate real-world production application behavior.

The app integrates Firebase SDK directly for secure authentication, real-time database synchronization, session persistence, and user state management, without using REST APIs. Angular Signals and Firebase listeners ensure instant UI updates and reliable auth state across refreshes and devices.

Key features include user registration and login, protected routes, vehicle listings with real-time availability, booking workflows, profile management, and fully responsive UI design. The project follows clean component architecture and scalable frontend patterns suitable for enterprise-level applications.

Luxro highlights strong frontend engineering skills, modern Angular practices, and real-time cloud integration, making it a solid portfolio project for frontend developer roles.
